title: Copy Number Variation
track: Genomic Variation

**Copy number variants (CNVs)** occur when parts of or entire chromosomes are
replicated or lost. CNVs occur in normal healthy individuals, with no outward
sign of disease. However, there are diseases that are due to CNVs such as Down
Syndrome, where individuals have an extra copy of chromosome 21, or Huntington's
disease where a short sequence "CAG" is replicated over 35 times in a single
gene. In cancer, cells with unstable genomes may duplicate sequences many times,
amplifying the genes that promote the disease, or cells may drop copies of genes
that prevent cancer.

Detecting CNVs computationally from sequencing data begins by mapping reads to a
reference genome and determining the read depth, or coverage. In theory, the
coverage should reflect the relative copy number. In practice, some DNA regions
get more counts than others simply because their sequences are more easily
mapped. In addition, duplicate reads generated by lab preparations may inflate
local counts, and sequence machine errors give inflated quality estimates for
some bases. CNV detection methods adjust the coverage estimates to remove each
of these effects. Coverage estimates at the base pair level are too small and
variable to reliably define a CNV, so smoothing methods are applied to derive a
mean estimate of coverage within a window, or bin. Last, CNV methods that rely
on read depth identify the boundaries of CNVs regions through segmentation or
modeling methods.

In general, CNV detection methods further refine their search by comparing
normalized coverage estimates to a panel of normal control genomes with the
expected two chromosomal copies. In cancer, the mapped counts from a tumor
sample are often compared to a normal genome from the same patient to further
refine the analysis. This comparison identifies changes due to disease rather
than the patient's natural variation.
