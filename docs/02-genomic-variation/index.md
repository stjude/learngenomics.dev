# Genomic Variation

During the course of an organism's life, changes to its underlying genetic code
will be introduced by a variety of processes. Many of these changes are harmless
and are the underlying current driving a species' evolution. Rarely, variation
within the genome or combinations thereof will cause adverse phenotypes in
individuals that carry the variation(s) [e.g. cancer]. The replicate-and-branch
nature of the cell lifecycle means that genetic code within different parts of
one's body evolve separately and slowly diverge from one another. This phenomenon
can be observed more starkly when considering the difference in genetic code
from humans separated by large geographic regions.
