[Learn Genomics] is a guide that aims to introduce the subject of genomics to software engineers and data scientists in a palatable, straightforward manner. It was originally written by software engineers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and now it has grown to a community-maintained project.

### Quickstart

The guide is built on top of [Docusaurus 2] with some simple, custom theming added on top. 
If you wish to build the guide locally, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# install the dependencies needed
$ npm install

# run a livereloading site
$ npm start
```

If you wish to build a static version of the site, you can do the following:

```bash
# build a static version of the site in the build/ directory.
$ npm run build
```
