# Learn Genomics (Redesign)

[Learn Genomics] is a guide that aims to introduce the subject of genomics to software engineers and data scientists in a palatable, straightforward manner. It was originally written by software engineers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and now it has grown to a community-maintained project.

This redesigned version is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), providing a modern, performant, and accessible learning experience.

## Getting started

To get started with this redesign, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Customizing

You can start editing this site by modifying the files in the `/src` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files.

## Global search

This site includes a global search powered by the [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) library. It's available by clicking the search input or by using the `⌘K` shortcut.

This feature requires no configuration and works out of the box by automatically scanning your documentation pages to build its index. You can adjust the search parameters by editing the `/src/mdx/search.mjs` file.
