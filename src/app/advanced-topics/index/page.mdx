# Introduction

You have now completed the main text of the guide—congrats! In this section, we include some guides that didn't quite fit into the flow of the main text. Each chapter here is a standalone section and should be considered more experimental in nature. As time goes on and content is developed within these chapters, it's possible we will move them into the flow of the main text.
